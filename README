summary:
This ruby script is used to find users the best deals on monitors on newegg, and alert them as soon as the deal appears.
steps:
1.install
2.setup search.txt
3. wait for that deal you always wanted to show up

note: these deals are only the best deals (sometimes ~50% off) and come from the newegg open box monitor selection. if you can find a good deal on the website currently, this bot will not be so useful, however if you dont see a good enough deal for you, this bot will make sure you know about the deal when(or if) it arises
